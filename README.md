Conversation with AI: The system offers interactive conversations with AI, providing an immersive learning experience.
Vocabulary Training: Users can practice words and phrases in different contexts.
API Integration: The application communicates with an external API to provide additional resources and data for language learning.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: Developed in TSX (TypeScript + JSX), using modern libraries to create dynamic interfaces.
Backend: Database usage for storing user data and their learning progress.
API Integration: The application interacts with an external API to integrate additional resources into the system.
This project is a great way to practice both programming skills and learning a new language!
